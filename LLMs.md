### Introduction: 


We have entered the era of generative artificial intelligence, which has manifested itself in various applications, ranging from the composition of
essays and creation of comics to the editing of films. The adoption rate of generative AI has surpassed that of any other consumer technology trend 
observed in the past ten years. The text generator ChatGPT, for instance, accumulated over one million users within a mere five-day period, while tens 
of millions of consumers have generated AI avatars.

The majority of venture capitalists regard generative AI as the forthcoming primary platform upon which entrepreneurs will establish groundbreaking 
products. At present, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency in addressing challenges pertaining to problem-solving. 
Consequently, even a simplistic game like Flappy Bird can be developed within a few hours. The capabilities of amateur programmers are significantly
amplified and augmented tenfold through the utilization of generative AI.

In the foreseeable future, it is plausible that average users will experience substantial empowerment in the realm of software development.
Extrapolating this trend, we may anticipate an era in approximately a decade where average users possess the ability to construct intricate software 
applications.

However, for the creation of serious applications, it is imperative that these models exhibit reliable behavior. Moreover, a mechanism must be established
to facilitate the provision of concrete requirements as input. Finally, it is essential to eliminate any surprises or unforeseen behavior in the output 
generated by these models, thereby ensuring the dependability and usability of the software developed using generative AI.

### Research Areas 

1. 100% reliability and edge cases. e.g Tesla example (need to think of alternative approach) 
2. Can’t solve reversal problems in healthcare - requires argumentation 
3. Can’t edit model 
4. Alignment (function. And RL) problems 
5. How do we query the LLMS in a privacy preserving way ? 
6. how do we do in a compute efficient way, how do we run it at the edge. how can we make your fridge a smart ridge, who knows about your nutrition intake and so on, without actually being connected to the internet. ?

### Misc. 

 Carnap’s book The Logical Structure of the World (1928) defined an explicit computational procedure for
 extracting knowledge from elementary experiences
